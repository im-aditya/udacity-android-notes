8. Android Min and Target Versions
  - *min sdk version* is the minimum version of the Android Operating System required to run your application.
    - The Android system will prevent the user from installing the application if the system's API Level is lower than the value specified in this attribute.
  - *target sdk version* is the version of Android that your app was created to run on.
    - Specifying this target version allows the platform to disable compatibility settings that are not required for the target version (which may otherwise be turned on in order to maintain forward-compatibility) or enable newer features that are not available to older applications.
  - *compile sdk version* is the the version of Android SDK that the build tools uses to compile & build the application in order to release, run, or debug.
  - Usually the compile sdk version and the target sdk version are the same.
9. Setting Min and Target
  - can use the app's build.gradle file
  - go to project structure -> app -> flavour tab
10. Running Your Code
11. Android Software Stack
   - Execution Process :
       - We start with the Android project
       - Gradle, which is a build & dependency management system, builds the project and package the byte code with all the resources and manifest files into an APK file
       - Then it is being signed and pushed to the device using the ADB.
   - Consists of 5 layers :
       1. Linux Kernel
         - Consists of all the drivers for interacting with the hardware
       2. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
         - provides standard interfaces that expose device hardware capabilities to the higher-level Java API framework
       3. Android Runtime
         - For devices running Android version 5.0 (API level 21) or higher, each app runs in its own process and with its own instance of the Android Runtime (ART).
         - ART is written to run multiple virtual machines on low-memory devices by executing **DEX** files, a bytecode format designed specially for Android that's optimized for minimal memory footprint.
         - Build toolchains, such as *Jack*, compile Java sources into DEX bytecode, which can run on the Android platform.
         - Some of the major features of ART include the following:
           - Ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation
           - Optimized garbage collection (GC)
           - Better debugging support, including a dedicated sampling profiler, detailed diagnostic exceptions and crash reporting, and the ability to set watchpoints to monitor specific fields
         - Prior to Android version 5.0 (API level 21), **Dalvik was the Android runtime**. If your app runs well on ART, then it should work on Dalvik as well, but the reverse may not be true.
       4. Native C/C++ Libraries
         - Many core Android system components and services, such as ART and HAL, are built from native code that require native libraries written in C and C++.
         - The Android platform provides Java framework APIs to expose the functionality of some of these native libraries to apps.
         - For example, you can access OpenGL ES through the Android frameworkâ€™s Java OpenGL API to add support for drawing and manipulating 2D and 3D graphics in your app.
       5. Java API Framework
         - The entire feature-set of the Android OS is available to you through APIs written in the Java language.
